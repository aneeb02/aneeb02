# Hi there 👋, I'm Aneeb

**Backend & Data-Oriented Software Engineer**

I build **backend-first applications** with a strong focus on APIs, databases, and data pipelines. I enjoy working on systems where correctness, performance, and clarity matter. From backend services to data-driven features, my interest lies in developing such applications.

I’m currently strengthening my foundation in **backend engineering** while also learning **data engineering**. I’m looking to collaborate on open-source, real-world projects.

---

## What I Work On

- Backend development with **Django** and **FastAPI**
- Designing **REST APIs** and real-time services
- Relational and NoSQL databases (**PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis**)
- Data handling, transformation, and pipeline-style workflows
- ML-powered features integrated via APIs (used as tools, not research)
- Mobile & web apps using **React Native** and **Next.js**

My background in **native advertising and campaign optimization** gives me a product mindset and comfort working with data at scale.
